# CatFacts
This is a small C++ program to trigger a single action on the hour every hour of the day,
originally used to send a friend of mine cat facts. 

It made use of the Unix mail command, and as
such would need heavy modification and an email library to be standalone, but it is still a good
reference for time-based events.
